                <p>Right now I am currently working full time active duty in the coast guard as a Second Class Boatswains Mate.
                    I run search and rescue missions for the boating public of the Newport Rhode Island area. I have more than 4 years
                    of active duty time I believe my time in the coast guard has given me great ablility to work as a team to work through
                    situation and great leadership qualities by running and coordinating search and rescue missions for multiple search and 
                    rescue assests at a time.

                <p> I am planing on getting out of the Coast Guard in a year and a half so I was looking for stuff to do and I was always very
                    interested in computers and always wanted to work with them then I found out about coding bootcamps and thought that would be a 
                    great way to quickly transition from my job in the Coast Guard to a tech job and found devCodeCamp. Currently enrolled 
                    in devCodeCamp's fullstack developers course and hopefully being able to land a job as a junior developer somewhere
                    and begin my career in tech. Im alittle more interested in being a front end side developer but I also find back end type 
                    development also pretty interesting.
